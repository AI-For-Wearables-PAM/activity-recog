# activity-recog
Initial work following a tutorial to use OpenCV for human activity recognition.


- The file `activity-recog.ipynb` shows the proof of concept created by following the tutorial [Introduction to Video Classification & Human Activity Recognition](https://learnopencv.com/introduction-to-video-classification-and-human-activity-recognition/)
- The code is a little messy and not all functions are used.
- The folder `data` is ignored for storage and PII reasons and will have to be added to the root of your local clone of this repo.
